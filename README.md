# Paywall-remover

## About

Newspapers (specially in Italy) already have ingent monetary contributions from government, therefore people must have the constitutional right of free information. 

With this goal in our souls and mind, this is a collection of simple JS scripts to automate the removal of different website's paywall. 

Any contribution is greatly appreciated.
